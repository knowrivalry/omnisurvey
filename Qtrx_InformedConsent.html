            <p>
                Thank you for participating in this research on rivalry.
                The full details about your participation are below (the informed consent statement),
                and here's the short version (TL;DR):
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Who are you?</span>
                    We're researchers studying rivalry (our info is at the bottom of this page)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Why are you doing this?</span>
                    To better understand rivalry relationships among organizations and their fans
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">What do I have to do?</span>
                    A survey, which should take about 9 minutes to complete
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Do I qualify?</span>
                    Probably, as long as you are 18 years old or older
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Any risks to me?</span>
                    Nope
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Must I do it?</span>
                    Nope. It's voluntary and you can stop at any time (including right now)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="TLDRQues">Are my responses confidential?</span>
                    Yes, and though data breaches happen, 
                    we've taken many steps to protect your data and anonymity

                    <p>
                        This is a survey to help us better understand rivalries between and among sport teams and their
                        fans. We are focused on adults, however, so you must be at least 18 years old.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>
                        What will I be asked to do?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        You'll be asked to answer a series of questions about your favorite team, its rivals, and the rival
                        teams' fans. Some versions of the survey have additional sections, such as your thoughts toward
                        non-rivals, views of sponsors, or ways you follow your favorite team. The end of the survey asks
                        basic demographic questions. This survey typically takes about 9 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation is voluntary. There is no penalty for not completing the survey, and you may
                        leave at any time by closing your browser window.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        What are the risks and benefits of participating?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        There are no foreseeable risks for participating in this study. There are no direct personal
                        benefits (e.g., no compensation), but there are benefits to society by contributing to our overall
                        knowledge of social groups (particularly sport fans) and their views toward rivals.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>What happens to my data?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your responses are held strictly confidential. Any data published or shared are made anonymous,
                        and we take several steps to protect the raw data and respondents' confidentiality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your data are grouped together ("aggregated") with others' responses and reported as part of a larger
                        set. In some cases your specific quotes may be used, but we do not use your name or any identifying
                        information that would allow you to be personally linked to the statement (or any of your other
                        data). The data are primarily used for academic purposes, such as publishing in academic journals
                        and presenting at conferences. They may also be used to educate industry practitioners (e.g., people
                        who work for sport teams) or as part of student projects, but again, only when individual responses
                        are first made anonymous and/or aggregated within a larger dataset. We also publish certain findings
                        publicly to help other researchers, typically on KnowRivalry.com. Our findings may be combined with
                        other researchers' data, but as always, no personally identifiable information for respondents will
                        be shared. Each respondent is assigned an ID number within our own database, so any reference to
                        your data will be as &quot;Respondent &num;1234&quot; (for example).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All data are stored on password protected computers. Data are backed up using encrypted,
                        password-protected, two-factor-authenticated online storage solutions and external hard drives
                        stored in locked rooms. Data are kept for the foreseeable future because one of our research goals
                        is to understand how perceptions of rivalry change over time (i.e., as part of a longitudinal
                        study). Should you ever wish to have your data removed, you can contact us directly and we will make
                        our best effort to remove your responses; however, removal may be impossible if we are unable to
                        match you to your responses. We collect as little identifiable information as possible, thus unless
                        you provide your email address or you have something particularly notable in your comments, we may
                        not be able to find your specific responses.
