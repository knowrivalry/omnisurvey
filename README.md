This is just a CDN for some of the data that feeds the Know Rivalry Omnisurvey.

<!---
This originated on Aux Dev's [GitHub page]("https://auxiliarydev.github.io/know-rivalry-omnisurvey/"). David forked it and started working off of his [GitHub]("https://github.com/B-D-T/know-rivalry-omnisurvey") because he didn't have write access to the Aux Dev one.  

## October 28, 2020  
David created the [UMassMigration]("https://github.com/B-D-T/know-rivalry-omnisurvey/tree/UMassMigration") branch to work off of without destroying anything.  

## Oct 30 - Nov 3  
David's UMassMigration code was the production code on AuxDev. After running into errors, David reverted his updates.  

## November 4, 2020  
David created the [KRAuxDevTest]("") repository on his own GitHub and made it a Pages site (github.io). He pointed Qualtrics at this site for testing.  
The change here was with `TeamRivals.html` and `TeamRivals.js`. 

## November 5, 2020 07:42 AM  
David has a working version, at least for the NBA.

## November 10, 2020 06:33 AM  
The version is working decently well, but still needs some help. David moved the **Production code back to AuxDev** in anticipation of meeting with Danny today to discuss.

## November 23, 2020 11:15 AM  
David migrated the production version to [Know Rivalry's GH page]("https://github.com/knowrivalry/omnisurvey").
